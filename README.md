# Pneumonia Classification
Classification Exercise on the [Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

The repository contains one Jupyter Notebook.

Main challenge was how to train the models with limited hardware.

My hardware setup is as follows:
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz, 3201 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)
- GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
- RAM: 16GB 2133 Mhz
- Disks: 1x 250GB SSD, 1x 1TB HD
